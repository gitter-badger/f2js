Hello, my name is Kevin Pham. I've been a product manager at a number of startups for several years now. I'm looking to become more technical, so one of the reasons I'm coding more frequently. My background is in business. I graduated from the Michael G. Foster School of Business at the University of Washington (#GoHuskies). Current goals for myself are to learn iOS, JavaScript, and UX.
